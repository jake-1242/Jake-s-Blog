<h1>Tip Calculator</h1>

<p>You can see it <a href="#">Here</a></p>

<p>
I wanted the user to be able to input the bill without the tip,a tip percentage and the ability to split the bill between people.

I added some basic styling with css to help add define the input and the output and just to make it a bit more visually interesting.

In Javascript I got the id's of elements created in the html file , so that I could use the user's input for totals. </p>
