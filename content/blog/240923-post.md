<h1>Tip Calculator</h1>

<p>You can see the tip calculator <a href="https://codepen.io/Jake-Barry-coding-projects/pen/wvROdVQ?editors=1111">here</a></p>

<br>
I wanted the user to be able to input the bill without the tip and add a tip percentage.I did this using a form with some validation to ensure people had to enter numbers , and for the tip percentage, it was numbers within a cetain range (0-100).

I added some basic styling with css to help add define the input and output just to make it a bit more visually interesting.
<br>
In Javascript I got the id's of elements created in the html file , so that I could use the input for totals. I also had to create an event listener so that when a person clicked calculate it wouldn't perform the default action and would instead use the function I created to output the calculations of the tip.
