<p>In this session we looked at pseudocode and how it can be used to help us. </p>

<p>Pseudocode simply put is laying out code without actually having to code. 
This can be advantageous when you're trying to lay out an idea as you don't have to get too hung up on the exact syntax.</p>

<p>It can also help when you're explaining to someone an idea but they programme in the same language as you. </p>

<p>In the first task I recreated some code and turned it into pseudocode.I laid it out as simply as possible without writing code but including key words like FOR , to indicate a loop . </p>

<p>In the second task I created some pseudocode for how to approach some problems like a function that could list a recipe and ingredients and a function check whether items in a library had been read or not. I used the same principles as the first task , and although I might not have known the exact syntax , I was creating a basis for how I'd lay out the function and what parts of the code would be involved. </p>
